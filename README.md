# Discord Bot
Alot has been removed from this bot in order to post it on github so be aware this is not fully functioning code. This is just to show that I do in fact know python and have used it in a project.

Keep in mind that this code was VERY sloppily written as it was never intended to become as big as it is. Initially this was just used to add roles to users who joined the server and its baloon'd quite heavily as you can see.

I plan to re write the whole thing in the coming months to update to the latest discord py and add alot of new features. The rewrite will also be open sourced so that anybody can add to it. For now however this giant monument to tech debt is all there is.
